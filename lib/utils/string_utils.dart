  static const DontMixOnline="Don’t mix online dating with social media. Avoid using photos from your social media accounts in your online dating profile. Why? They’re too easy to trace.

No need to share your email, phone number or social media handle—just some quality face-to-face time with new friends. For your safety, here are a few things to keep in mind when using the video chat:";

";

It is always exciting getting to know someone new and sharing personal details about yourself and your immediate circle seems natural. On those first initial dates, keep private details private.

If they continue to push the subject, re-evaluate meeting in person and/or end the conversation entirely.";
  static const NeverMeetOnline="Never meet an online date in their car, in the parking lot, at a motel/hotel or any place where you can’t get away safely and quickly. If at any time you feel uncomfortable, go with your gut and get out of that situation. Do not hesitate! You also can consider carrying a can of pepper spray, just in case.";

  static const AlwaysKeepAnEye="Always Keep an Eye on Your Food and Drinks. Never leave your food and/or drinks unattended. Should you have to step away from the table, place a napkin over your plate. And never feel bad about requesting a new drink if you recognize any suspicious behavior(s) from anyone at or around your table. Date rape drugs are easy to administer and do not change the flavor or appearance of your drink. Keeping an eye on your drink at all times is the best way to stay safe.";
